# 2020ify-leetcoding
Daily practice with leetcode problems like it's 2020 - with tests, CI/CD, ancient language (C) but with modern tools


## ðŸ¤” But why?

To practice my coding skills in C and Python, but also to experiment with modern tools of software development. I'll try to explore different approaches to testing, C and Python integration, CI/CD and code distribution. I hope to find some useful solutions and inspire other people to broaden their coding practice.

## Tools

tests: pytest, coverage  
devops: Travis CI  
formatting: commitizen, flake, C-linter (?)  
documentation: Sphinx,  interrogate  
distribution: Docker  
C/Python integration: Python's module `ctypes`
